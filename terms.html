                        <p>
                            These terms of use are entered into by and between You and 108 Entertainment, Inc.
                            (“Company,” “we,” or “us“). The following terms and conditions, together with any documents
                            they expressly incorporate by reference (collectively, “Terms“), govern your use and access
                            to our services, programs, courses, and websites, including www.marcodeb.com and all
                            subdomains thereof, and include any content, functionality, and services offered on or
                            through such services, programs, courses, and websites (collectively, the “Service“),
                            whether accessed as a guest or a registered user.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Please read the Terms of Use carefully before you start to use the Service. By using the
                            Service, you accept and agree to be bound and abide by these Terms and our Privacy Policy,
                            found at https://marcodeb.com/privacy-policy, incorporated herein by reference. If you do
                            not want to agree to these Terms or the Privacy Policy, you must not access or use the

                        <p>
                            Please note: Section XIV of these Terms contains an arbitration clause and class action
                            waiver that applies to all users. It affects how disputes with the Company are resolved. By
                            accepting these Terms, you agree to be bound by this arbitration clause and class action
                            waiver. Please read it carefully.

                            THIS SERVICE DOES NOT PROVIDE MEDICAL CARE. We do not provide medical advice, diagnosis, or
                            treatment, nor are we a medical service provider. Content on the Service, which may include
                            text, graphics, images, or other information produced by us or obtained from third party
                            content providers, and other material contained on the Service, are for informational
                            purposes only. Nothing on this Service is intended to be a substitute for professional
                            medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always seek the advice of your physician or other
                            qualified healthcare provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition.
                            Never disregard professional medical advice or delay in seeking it because of something you
                            have read, seen, or heard on the Service. If you think you have a medical emergency, call
                            your doctor or 911 immediately. We do not recommend or endorse any specific tests, products,
                            procedures, opinions or other information or services that may be made available to you
                            through the Service. Reliance on any information provided by us, or others appearing on the
                            Service, or other visitors to the Service, is solely at your own risk.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I. Changes to the Terms of Use.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We may revise and update these Terms from time to time at our sole discretion. All changes
                            are effective immediately when we post them, and apply to all access to and use of the
                            Service thereafter. Any changes to the dispute resolution provisions set out in Section XIV
                            will not apply to any disputes for which the parties have actual notice (or to any claim
                            that was filed) before the date the change is posted. If we make changes to these Terms, we
                            will post the revised Terms on the Service and update the “Last Modified” date at the top of
                            these Terms. We will also endeavor to send a notice to the email address that you provided
                            to us in order to let you know about revisions. Your continued use of the Service following
                            the posting of revised Terms or notification thereof by email means that you accept and
                            agree to the changes. You are expected to check this page from time to time so you are aware
                            of any new or additional terms, as they are binding on you.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            II. Requirements for Use of the Service
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            a. <br> Eligibility. The Service is offered and available to users who are 18 years of age
                            or older. By using this Service, you represent and warrant that you are of legal age to form
                            a binding contract with us in your applicable jurisdiction. If you do not meet these
                            requirements, you must not access or use the Service. The Service is not available to any
                            users previously suspended or removed from the Service by us.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            b. <br> Devices. Use of, and secure access to, the Service may require compatible devices,
                            Internet access, and certain software (fees may apply). Your device may require periodic
                            updates and your experience and ability to access the Service may be affected by the
                            performance of these factors. The latest version of applicable software may be required for
                            certain transactions or features. You agree that meeting these requirements is your
                            responsibility.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            c. <br> Availability of the Service. The Service, or any feature or part thereof, may not be
                            available in all languages or in all countries and we make no representation that the
                            Service, or any feature or part thereof, is appropriate or available for use in any
                            particular location. To the extent you choose to access and use the Service, you do so at
                            your own initiative and are responsible for compliance with any applicable laws. We reserve
                            the right to withdraw or amend the Service, and any content or material we provide through
                            the Service, in our sole discretion without notice. We will not be liable if for any reason
                            all or any part of the Service is unavailable at any time or for any period. From time to
                            time, we may restrict access to some parts of the Service, or the entire Service, to users,
                            including registered users.
